      <description>IWSDC reviewing will be double blind. Each submitted paper will be revised by three experts.
The paper length should match that intended for final publication. Papers are limited to 8 pages (excluding references), including figures and tables. While there is no limit to the number of references, reviewers are instructed to check for pertinence. Citation of any of the co-authorsâ€™ published work must be done in the third person. Reference to unpublished work can be made by anonymizing it, including it as supplementary material, and referencing it as Anonymous.</description>
